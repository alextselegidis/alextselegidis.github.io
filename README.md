# Personal Website [alextselegidis.com](http://alextselegidis.com)

Welcome to my personal website repository, a place where I ramble about myself and show off what I did in the past but don't get me wrong, all I want to do is produce good software :)

The goal of this website is to be as lightweight as possible without being ugly so I avoided the use of JavaScript for animations and used plain CSS with the help of Skeleton and PostCSS plugins to spicy things up. I hope that you'll find some interesting snippets in the PCSS files.
