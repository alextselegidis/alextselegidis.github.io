                15 and have spent countless hours of imagining, solving and planning things that come in
                my way. I am always very serious with what I do and my ambitions are always high as to
                never let my self down. All I am looking forward is the next project.

            <h2>Work</h2>

            <p>
                During all these years I have taken part into a big variety of projects, some academic,
                some from my previous employments and some as a freelancer but these are the ones that
                I would like to share with you. Kinda shows the different stages I went through until today.
            </p>

            <h3>Easy!Appointments</h3>

            <p id="easyappointments">
                This is the most important project that I have in my portfolio at the time being. It was
                developed for my BSc Thesis and is still maintained as an offer to the generous open source
                community. The project is translated into 21 languages and is used from offices, doctors,
                embassies, massage &amp; cosmetic salons and a big variety of companies.

                Check it out at <a href="http://easyappointments.org">http://easyappointments.org</a>

                <strong>
                    * Although I still develop this project I also undertake customizations as a freelancer.
                    Consider sending me  a message about you modifications and we can discuss possible solutions.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Infobox</h3>

            <p id="infobox">
                Infobox is a desktop CRM application that can manage efficiently all your business needs.
                The application includes a full- featured organizer, a complete customer transactions system
                and a clever utility for creating custom print reports from all the database information.

                Infobox was developed on behalf of the Action Computers company for public distribution in
                Greece. You can find more information in the following address:
                <a href="http://freeinfobox.gr">http://freeinfobox.gr</a>
            </p>

            <h3>AppHold</h3>

            <p id="apphold">
                AppHold is a web system that aims to track the licensing and error state of public distributed
                applications. It contains a web management center and a web service that communicates with the
                client executables and enables a company to manage remotely their customers' software licenses.
                AppHold is currently being used by the Infobox project for monitoring the application's licensing
                properties and its error report events. It will be used for future projects.
            </p>

            <h3>Freelance</h3>

            <p id="freelance">
                Since 2009 I have work with many companies and professionals about projects that mainly had to
                do with the public re-presentation in the web. Some of them were static HTML5 websites and others
                full-featured CMS installations with custom plugins and unique themes from scratch, in order to
                achieve better results. In addition I had also built desktop programs and utilities that enhanced
                the intern workflow of respective clients.

                The last years I tend to work more and more with Node.js ecosystem which has by far more
                possibilites for rapid app development. Tools like Atom Electron, React Native and Apache
                Cordova enable programmers to develop apps that run natively in desktop or mobile devices.
            </p>

            <h3>Academic</h3>

            <p id="academic">
                During my bachelor studies I developed along with other students some projects that are worth
                noticing.I got to learn a lot of interesting stuff while developing software with other programs.
                Co-operation and organizationare very important in order to successfully achieve the team's goals.
                Some of the projects where simple 2D Arcade Games, Database applications, and some math calculations
                (using MatLab).

                n September 2012 I was accepted by Sigma Solutions to fulfil my academic internship. During
                the 7 months in the company, I got involved into many projects and technologies, but I primarily
                dealt with web apps.

                There were situations were I started and completed the project by myself, some that required
                collaboration with fellow developers in the company and some that needed technical support on
                several issues that might appear. This experience got me into a competitive business workflow
                that needed high standards result for the final solutions.

                During my apprenticeship I used many technologies that had to do with the web development.
                Some of them are: WordPress (plugin and theme development), Joomla, Facebook Applications,
                PHP frameworks, ASP.NET + Web services, MSSQL Server, several Google APIs (custom search
                engine, maps), newsletters and many more.
            </p>

            <h3>Coming Soon</h3>

            <p>
                I think that by now I've made it clear that I love programming. That includes programming
                in my free time (yes I know it's never enough). For that reason I have created the BigBlackCode
                team with dear friends in order to produce open source magic. Here are some projects that are
                coming soon.
            </p>

            <h4>SpaceGuard</h4>

            <p>
                An HTML5 arcade game in Space where the player has to protect his spaceship from the
                attackers. The game will be responsive and mobile-friendly and it will feature a unique
                gameplay for the web standards. Check the progress of the game on GitHub.

                <a href="https://github.com/BigBlackCode/spaceguard">https://github.com/BigBlackCode/spaceguard</a>
            </p>

            <h4>Mind Escape</h4>

            <p>
                Made for puzzle lovers and hidden object seekers Mind Escape will be a combination of all the
                elements we like in escape games along with extra features made for Android devices. The game
                concept is ready but the development was halted until more time is available from all team members.
            </p>

            <h4>Easy!Freelancers</h4>

            <p>
                Even though this is not part of the BigBlackCode team, Easy!Freelancers will be another useful
                application for every freelancer that wants to organize his work, customers, projects and spent
                time. The project will be developed with React and Atom Electron framework as a desktop app and
                it will support synchronization with Dropbox and Google Drive. More information will become
                available soon.
