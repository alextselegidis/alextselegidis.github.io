                                        from Greece, currently living in Bremen. I have been working as a programmer since I was
                                        15 and have spent countless hours of imagining, solving and planning things that come in
                                        my way. I am always very serious with what I do and my ambitions are always high as to
                                        never let myself down. All I am looking forward is the next project.

                                        Today's possibilities are just endless. There are tools and utilities that enable developers

                                            Infobox is a desktop CRM application that can manage efficiently all your business needs.
                                            The application includes a full-featured organizer, a complete customer transactions system
                                            and a clever utility for creating custom print reports from all the database information.

                                            Infobox was developed on behalf of Action Computers (GR) for public distribution in Greece.

                                            AppHold is a web system that aims to track the licensing and error state of public distributed
                                            applications. It contains a web management center and a web service that communicates with the
                                            client executables and enables a company to manage remotely their customers' software licenses.
                                            AppHold is currently being used by the Infobox project for monitoring the application's licensing
                                            properties and its error report events. It will be used for future projects as well. An open source
                                            version of the core might become available soon.

                                        <p>
                                            Since 2009 I have worked with many companies and professionals about projects that mainly had to
                                            do with public re-presentation in the web. Some of them were static HTML5 websites and others
                                            full-featured CMS installations with custom plugins and unique themes designed from scratch, in order 
                                            to achieve better results. In addition, I had also built desktop programs and utilities that enhanced
                                            the intern workflow of former clients.

                                            The last years I tend to work more and more with the Node.js ecosystem which has by far more
                                            possibilites for rapid application development. Tools like Electron, React Native, Ionic and 
                                            Apache Cordova enable me to develop apps that run natively in desktop or mobile devices.

                                        <p>
                                            During my bachelor studies I developed along with other students some projects that are worth
                                            noticing. I got to learn a lot of interesting stuff including how to lead a team of programmers 
                                            and organize them in order to meet strict deadlines.

                                            Co-operation and organization play an important role for successfully achieving the team's goals.
                                            Some of the projects where simple 2D Arcade Games, Database applications, and scientific 
                                            calculations (using MatLab or similar simulation tools).

                                            In September 2012 I was accepted by Sigma Solutions to fulfil my academic internship. During
                                            the 7 months in the company, I got involved into many projects and technologies, most of them
                                            in the web domain.

                                            There were situations were I started and completed the project by myself, some that required
                                            collaboration with fellow developers of the company and some that needed technical support on
                                            several issues that might appear. This experience got me into a competitive business workflow
                                            that needed high standard results for the final solutions.

                                            I think that by now I've made it clear that I love programming. That includes programming
                                            in my free time (yes I know it's never enough). For that reason I have created the BigBlackCode
                                            team with dear friends in order to produce open source magic. Here are some projects that are
                                            coming soon.

                                            The game concept is ready but the development was halted until more time is available from all team members.
