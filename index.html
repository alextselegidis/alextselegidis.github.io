                                        Infobox is a desktop CRM application that can manage efficiently all your business needs.
                                        The application includes a full- featured organizer, a complete customer transactions system
                                        and a clever utility for creating custom print reports from all the database information.

                                        Infobox was developed on behalf of the Action Computers company for public distribution in
                                        Greece. You can find more information in the following address:

                                        AppHold is a web system that aims to track the licensing and error state of public distributed
                                        applications. It contains a web management center and a web service that communicates with the
                                        client executables and enables a company to manage remotely their customers' software licenses.
                                        AppHold is currently being used by the Infobox project for monitoring the application's licensing
                                        properties and its error report events. It will be used for future projects.

                                    <p>
                                        Since 2009 I have work with many companies and professionals about projects that mainly had to
                                        do with the public re-presentation in the web. Some of them were static HTML5 websites and others
                                        full-featured CMS installations with custom plugins and unique themes from scratch, in order to
                                        achieve better results. In addition I had also built desktop programs and utilities that enhanced
                                        the intern workflow of respective clients.

                                        The last years I tend to work more and more with Node.js ecosystem which has by far more
                                        possibilites for rapid app development. Tools like Atom Electron, React Native and Apache
                                        Cordova enable programmers to develop apps that run natively in desktop or mobile devices.

                                    <p>
                                        During my bachelor studies I developed along with other students some projects that are worth
                                        noticing.I got to learn a lot of interesting stuff while developing software with other programs.
                                        Co-operation and organizationare very important in order to successfully achieve the team's goals.
                                        Some of the projects where simple 2D Arcade Games, Database applications, and some math calculations
                                        (using MatLab).

                                        n September 2012 I was accepted by Sigma Solutions to fulfil my academic internship. During
                                        the 7 months in the company, I got involved into many projects and technologies, but I primarily
                                        dealt with web apps.

                                        There were situations were I started and completed the project by myself, some that required
                                        collaboration with fellow developers in the company and some that needed technical support on
                                        several issues that might appear. This experience got me into a competitive business workflow
                                        that needed high standards result for the final solutions.

                                        During my apprenticeship I used many technologies that had to do with the web development.
                                        Some of them are: WordPress (plugin and theme development), Joomla, Facebook Applications,
                                        PHP frameworks, ASP.NET + Web services, MSSQL Server, several Google APIs (custom search
                                        engine, maps), newsletters and many more.
